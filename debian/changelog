    libraries to `g-ir-scanner --library` that do not contain any functions
    directly called by the dumper.

  [ Simon McVittie, Jeremy Bícha ]
  * Add a nogir build profile

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * d/control: Correct a misleading comment.
    It's g-ir-scanner, not g-ir-compiler, that runs the dumper executable.
  * Use host-architecture g-ir-compiler, etc. when cross-compiling.
    When setting up the cross wrappers for g-ir-compiler, etc. I had
    assumed that g-ir-compiler was a simple transformation from
    GIR XML into binary, which varied only by its endianness. Unfortunately,
    it is not: it also transforms abstract types such as size_t into
    equivalent fixed-size types such as guint64, which requires knowledge
    of the size of each type.
    Instead of running the build architecture g-ir-compiler and
    telling it to use the host architecture search path, install upstream's
    g-ir-compiler etc. into ${pkglibdir}, and set up cross wrappers
    that will automatically detect whether we can run them directly or
    whether we must use qemu-user. We already had logic for this for the
    dumper executable that is run by g-ir-scanner, which is always a
    host-architecture binary.
    This involves running qemu more often, but does have the side benefit
    that we no longer require the build and host endianness to be the same,
    because everything that interacts the typelib is now a host binary
    (possibly running under emulation). (Closes: #1066900)

  * d/control, d/gbp.conf, d/watch: Branch for 1.78.x
  * dh_girepository: Avoid generating a dependency on
    libgirepository1.0-dev.
    We don't want other -dev packages to depend on libgirepository1.0-dev
    if we can help it, because it isn't Multi-Arch co-installable,
    even though when installed it provides the highest-precedence
    version of GLib-2.0.gir (as a symlink to the real file). Instead,
    we would prefer dependent packages to depend on the package that
    really contains GLib-2.0.gir, which is gir1.2-glib-2.0-dev.
    Handle this generically so that if there are other pairs of packages
    in a similar situation, they will also be covered. (Closes: #1065332)
  * d/control: Make g-i explicitly depend on g-i-bin, not just via a

  * policy: Clarify when (not) to use the nogir build-profile.
    We don't need to add it indiscriminately to every package with
    GIR; it's only useful for packages that are either involved in
    bootstrapping, or difficult to cross-compile any other way, or being
    used as a harmless example of how to use this build profile with a
    particular build system.
  * policy: Consider the nogir build-profile to be stable.
    There didn't seem to be any objection to it on debian-devel.

  * Replace exact version matches by gir1.2-freedesktop(-dev) with
    a minimum.
    As with gir1.2-girepository-2.0(-dev), we need these to depend
    on gir1.2-glib-2.0 (>= 1.78.x) instead of (= 1.78.x), so that
    src:glib2.0 can take over those binary packages gracefully. Instead
    of hard-coding the dependencies, put the ${gir:Depends} back, and
    postprocess the output of dh_girepository instead of ignoring it.

  * gir1.2-girepository-2.0{,-dev}: Don't force GLib to match exactly.
    src:glib2.0 is going to take over the gir1.2-glib-2.0{,-dev}
    package names in 2.79.x, but it will have its
    own gir1.2-girepository-3.0{,-dev}. To keep our
    gir1.2-girepository-2.0{,-dev} installable, relax their dependencies
    to not be in lockstep.
    This would not usually be allowed, but GLib-2.0 and the other
    affected typelibs are conceptually part of glib2.0 anyway - they
    were only built by this source package up until now to avoid circular
    dependencies.

  * d/rules: Tell dh_python3 to look for private giscanner modules.
    Previously we were only doing this for the gobject-introspection

    we moved the giscanner implementation to g-i-bin. (Closes: #1061141)

  * d/control: gobject-introspection Depends on libglib2.0-dev.
    Otherwise, pkg-config lookup for gobject-introspection-1.0 will fail,
    which in turn makes Meson's gnome.generate_gir() fail. In practice,
    this probably only affects glib2.0 itself, because every other
    library that generates GIR XML is very likely to depend on GLib.
  * d/rules: Consistently use architecture comparison to detect cross-builds.
    This is a little more user-friendly: if a developer forgets to set
    DEB_BUILD_PROFILES=cross, but the required cross-tools happen to be
    installed anyway, the build will still work.
  * GObject-Introspection mini-policy:
    - Link to a list of packages known not to support multiarch GIR XML
    - Add underlines below section headings for better clarity
    - Clarify advice to use ${gir:Depends}, ${gir:Provides}
    - Packages should now depend on gir1.2-glib-2.0-dev, etc. if needed.
      -dev packages that use ${gir:Depends} will automatically
      start following this advice when they are rebuilt with
      gobject-introspection 1.78.1-7 or later.
    - Packages that only build typelibs need the same Build-Depends
      as packages that build GIR XML
    - Relax the requirement to depend on libgirepository1.0-dev
    - Clarify that Build-Depends(-Arch,-Indep) may be conditional
    - Provide a draft of the nogir build-profile, for future discussion
      on -devel

    - Move to gobject-introspection.
      This should make it a bit more discoverable.

gobject-introspection (1.78.1-10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/control: g-i Depends on g-i-bin for same kernel, not just same endian.
    If the host and build architecture are different kernels
    (cross-compiling for Hurd on Linux or vice versa) then qemu-user is
    not going to work. In practice qemu-user is only available on Linux
    anyway, so this restricts us to cross-compiling for Linux on Linux,
    or native builds.
  * d/control: Make g-i-bin Multi-Arch: foreign.
    The release team's migration tools now handle the case where :any
    appears on a dependency on a virtual package name that is provided by
    a Multi-Arch: allowed real package (see #1059929), but it's simpler
    if we don't have to rely on that subtlety. (Helps: #1030223)
  * d/cross-g-ir-tool.in: Autodetect whether we can run host binaries.
    Instead of assuming that we need qemu-user to run anything whose
    architecture does not match Python's, run a small test program from
    the host architecture and see what happens. This means we'll use a
    configured binfmt implementation if any, falling back to qemu-user
    if none. (Helps: #1030223)
  * Rename Debian-specific elf-get-needed tool to deb-elf-get-needed.

    During development of the changes that were released as 1.78.1-7,

  * Provide the libgirepository-1.0.so symlink in gobject-introspection
    (which is depended on by libgirepository-1.0-dev), and not directly in
    libgirepository-1.0-dev.
    This is a workaround for a Meson issue,
    https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/12680, in which the
    dumper binary is unnecessarily linked to libgirepository-1.0 even
    if no such dependency was declared.
    The C headers for the library are still in libgirepository-1.0-dev,
    to ensure that packages that use the library (like gjs and pygobject)
    are still forced to build-depend on libgirepository-1.0-dev (or

  * Split GIRepository-2.0 into its own binary package.
    During the GNOME 46 (GLib 2.79.x) cycle, gir1.2-glib-2.0 will need
    to be taken over by the glib2.0 source package. However, GLib 2.79.x
    does not build GIRepository-2.0.typelib; instead, it has a version of
    the same library with API/ABI changes, GIRepository-3.0.typelib. As
    a result, we need to separate these two.
    Newer uploads of gjs and pygobject have made sure to pull in the
    GIRepository-2.0 typelib. Add Breaks on versions that were too old
    to have that dependency.
    Cinnamon's cjs also uses GIRepository, but only in the implementation
    of functionality that Cinnamon doesn't actually appear to be using
    (imports.package), so no Breaks are needed for that.
  * Split GIR XML out from libgirepository1.0-dev.
    This introduces new binary packages gir1.2-freedesktop-dev,
    gir1.2-glib-2.0-dev and gir1.2-girepository-2.0-dev.
    gir1.2-glib-2.0{,-dev} are likely to be taken over by the glib2.0
    source package in a future release (as part of GNOME 46), so use
    greater-than-or-equal dependencies instead of lockstep dependencies
    for those.
    To allow gir1.2-glib-2.0-dev to be Multi-Arch: same, install its
    GIR XML into the architecture-specific location. Some consumers of
    GIR XML do not yet search that location, so provide a symlink in
    libgirepository1.0-dev which provides backward compatibility.
    (Closes: #859013)
  * Move native binaries to gobject-introspection-bin.
    As an implementation detail, the upstream-provided executables are
    now in gobject-introspection-bin. These unprefixed versions continue
    to use appropriate search paths for the native (build) architecture.
    The architecture-prefixed versions continue to be provided by the
    gobject-introspection package; that package is now Multi-Arch: same,
    allowing the prefixed versions to be used while cross-compiling.
    Because binary typelibs are in an endian-dependent format, the build
    and host architectures must be of the same endianness, which is
    achieved by using a virtual package. In practice all Debian release
    architectures except s390x are little-endian, and so are many ports
    architectures, so this will only be a practical concern for s390x
    and older ports architectures like powerpc and m68k.
    The gobject-introspection package now includes the pkg-config metadata
    gobject-introspection-1.0.pc, which is how Autotools and Meson build
    systems normally discover the command-line tools. The few packages
    that link to the libgirepository-1.0 shared library (mostly language
    bindings like gjs and python3-gi) will still need to build-depend
    on its -dev package in addition to gobject-introspection.
    (Helps: #801672, #905715)
  * Split shared library development files into libgirepository-1.0-dev.
    libgirepository1.0-dev has historically had three roles: it's the
    equivalent of libc6-dev for the libgirepository-1.0 shared library, it
    also pulls in the gobject-introspection CLI tools, and it also pulls
    in (or historically, contained) the GIR XML for basic libraries.
    Now those three roles are taken over by libgirepository-1.0-dev,
    gobject-introspection and gir1.2-*-dev, respectively, leaving
    libgirepository1.0-dev as essentially a metapackage.
    libgirepository1.0-dev is not Multi-Arch: same and cannot become
    Multi-Arch: same without breaking backwards compatibility, but all
    three of its replacements are.
    The one unique piece of functionality that is still provided by
    libgirepository1.0-dev is that it makes GLib-2.0.gir available in
    the legacy location /usr/share/gir-2.0/GLib-2.0.gir, which makes it
    available to older code-generation tools that have not been updated
    to read from the architecture-specific directory.
    (Closes: #801672, #905715)
  * dh_girepository: Generate dependencies for GIR from this source package.
    Now that gir1.2-glib-2.0-dev, gir1.2-girepository-2.0-dev and
    gir1.2-freedesktop-dev are separate, Multi-Arch: same packages,
    there's no barrier to generating dependencies on them.
  * d/tests: Test both libgirepository-1.0-dev and libgirepository1.0-dev
  * Add a Lintian override for gir1.2-glib-2.0-dev's large /usr/share
  * Add a README.Debian describing how to make packages containing GIR XML
    and/or typelibs cross-compilable

  * dh_girepository:
    - Fix generation of GIR XML -> typelib dependency
    - Don't generate Depends for GIR XML included by private GIR XML.
      It's somewhat common for packages like gnome-shell and cinnamon
      to ship GIR XML in a private location in a non-"-dev"-suffixed
      package. In such cases, development/compilation is not the primary
      purpose of the package, so we don't want to force a dependency
      on the -dev package that contains an included GIR XML file. For
      example, it would be inappropriate to force cinnamon to depend on
      libmuffin-dev, or gnome-shell on libmutter-dev.
      (Helps: #1057391)
  * policy:
    - Relax naming and dependency requirements for private GIR XML.
      As discussed on #1057391, this mini-policy is primarily for public
      GIR XML and public typelibs. (Helps: #1057391)

    to cross-compile typelibs.
  * d/p/Drop-GIO-from-libgirepository-s-dependencies.patch:
    Add patch from upstream to avoid depending on GIO in type-dumping tool.
    This is needed for forward-compatibility with GLib 2.79.x.
  * Install GLib-2.0.gir into multiarch location, with a compatibility
    symlink.
    This will help to start the process of updating dependent packages
    to be able to load GLib-2.0.gir and other GIR XML from the multiarch
    location. (Helps: #859013)
  * Generate architecture-prefixed executables.
    These will eventually make it possible to cross-compile
    GIR XML and typelibs for (for example) riscv64-linux-gnu
    libraries on an x86_64-linux-gnu build system, by invoking
    riscv64-linux-gnu-g-ir-scanner and so on. (Helps: #801672, #905715)
  * Edit pkg-config metadata to point to architecture-prefixed tools
  * Install a Meson cross-file to force use of the prefixed tools
    If necessary, Meson can be invoked as
    "meson --cross-file ${DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE}-gobject-introspection.ini"
    to use this.
  * d/control, d/rules: Use a prebuilt g-i when cross-building.
    We can generate a special variant of debian/cross-g-ir-tool.in that wraps
    the upstream g-ir-scanner, etc. binaries with an appropriate search path
    and executable wrapper to adapt them for the host architecture.

  * dh_girepository: Generate ${gir:Depends} for GIR XML -> typelib.
    For example, this should make it unnecessary to hard-code libfoo-dev
    Depends: gir1.2-foo-0 (= ${binary:Version}).

  * dh_girepository, policy.txt: Don't depend on -dev packages provided by
    gir1.2-freedesktop.
    Until we can split up libgirepository1.0-dev into smaller binary
    packages (#859013) or split out GIR XML from other -dev packages
    (#1030223), either of which will require trips through the NEW queue,
    it's undesirable for other -dev packages to hard-require it, because
    that will make them non-multiarch-friendly (due to #801672). For now,
    assume that all GIR XML provided by src:gobject-introspection will
    be pulled in by the gobject-introspection toolchain rather than by
    -dev packages' dependencies.

gobject-introspection (1.78.1-3) experimental; urgency=medium

  * dh_girepository: Warn if Build-Depends: gir1.2-foo-0-dev is missing.
    If the package builds GIR XML with <include name="Foo" version="0"/>,
    then it should build-depend on gir1.2-foo-0-dev <!nogir>. This
    will allow us to move GIR XML from libfoo-dev into a separate
    gir1.2-foo-0-dev binary package when all dependent source packages
    have added the build-dependency, making it possible to build libfoo
    without GObject-Introspection. (Helps: #1030223)
  * policy: Say more about build-dependencies
  * dh_girepository: Remove tracking of typelibs in the multiarch path.
    This used to generate a versioned Depends, but that was removed in
    1.54.0-2 (2017).
  * dh_girepository: Show a warning for typelibs in the pre-multiarch location.
    Debian's gobject-introspection only searches this location as a
    result of a Debian-specific patch which we would prefer to remove.
    This warning corresponds to typelib-not-in-multiarch-directory
    in Lintian.
  * Search for GIR XML in /usr/lib/*/gir-1.0.
    A subset of GIR XML genuinely varies between architectures,
    and we need to install that into ${libdir} for multiarch
    co-installability.  However, changing the girdir unconditionally
    would make most libraries with GIR XML fail to build, and most
    libraries' GIR XML doesn't actually vary between architectures
    anyway: it's analogous to C/C++ header files.  Instead, set
    gobject-introspection's internal gir_dir_prefix to ${libdir} so that
    it searches /usr/lib/MULTIARCH/gir-1.0. It will also still search
    /usr/share/gir-1.0, as a result of #455 upstream.
    Write girdir=${datadir}/gir-1.0 into its .pc file, so that
    third-party libraries will still default to installing GIR XML into
    /usr/share/gir-1.0. This will continue to be appropriate for the
    majority of GIR XML, for example in libflatpak-dev.
    Several consumers of GIR XML do not yet search /usr/lib/*/gir-1.0,
    so for now we continue to install GLib-2.0.gir into /usr/share,
    even though it has architecture-dependent contents. Separating out
    the GIR XML into its own binary package will be a good opportunity
    to change that to the more correct location, but that will require
    a trip through NEW, so let's get the groundwork into place first.

  * d/.gitignore: Add
  * d/rules, d/clean: Clean up man page declaratively
  * d/rules: Use one run of dh_girepository for all packages.
    In fact it was acting on all packages each time anyway, because the -p
    option was interpreted as dh_girepository's -p./gir1.2-glib-2.0 (load from
    private directory) and not as debhelper's --package (see #703941).
  * d/rules: Run dh_girepository in verbose mode for this package
  * dh_girepository.1: Mention the unusual meaning of -p for this tool
    (mitigates: #703941)
  * d/rules: Don't delete test data from glib during clean
  * d/copyright: Update
  * Use the same build directory for all architectures.
    This makes GIRepository-2.0.gir architecture-independent, so it no
    longer needs a solution to #1029957 and related bugs.
    (GLib-2.0.gir still has architecture-dependent contents, though.)
  * dh_girepository:
    - Generate gir:Provides substvar for typelibs in public locations
    - Generate gir:Provides substvar for GIR XML in public locations
      (Helps: #1030223)
    - Generate gir:Depends substvar for GIR XML, following <include>
    - Try to depend on GIR packages by their canonical names, if they
      exist as Provides
    - Pick up versioned B-D (if any) from GIR packages' canonical names
    - Use the host architecture gcc for compilation
  * policy:
    - Suggest using Provides: ${gir:Provides} for typelibs
    - Describe gir1.2-foo-2.0-dev naming, and suggest ${gir:Provides}
    - Packages must not have Provides for files they don't contain.
      GObject-Introspection relies on running an executable of the host
      architecture, so when cross-compiling, we will likely need to disable
      it via a build-profile. If this results in GIR XML and typelibs not
      being produced, then it would be misleading to have these Provides in
      the package(s) that would ordinarily have contained them.
    - Packages with GIR XML should depend on GIR XML they <include>.
      Dependencies on the core modules provided by gir1.2-glib-2.0 are
      excluded from this: we assume that libgirepository1.0-dev will pull
      those in, and it would be undesirable to depend on
      gir1.2-glib-2.0-dev while it still can't be multiarch (see #1029957).
    - Fix an inconsistency.
      Section 3 said that the packages with GIR XML must depend on the
      corresponding typelibs, but section 4 said this was unnecessary.
      Keep the stricter requirement.

  * Generate a dependency on libgirepository-1.0-1-with-libffi8 where needed.
    A few gobject-introspection symbols have libffi data structures in their
    arguments or results, resulting in crashes if a dependent package is
    not expecting the same ABI of libffi. Add a Provides on a virtual
    package with a programmatically-generated name such as
    libgirepository-1.0-1-with-libffi8, and generate dependencies on that
    virtual package if the affected symbols are used, so that
    gobject-introspection and its users are all on the same side of each
    future libffi transition. (Closes: #995032)
  * d/control.in: Add Breaks on cjs, gjs, etc. that expect the libffi7 ABI.
    Newer versions of these libraries have been binNMU'd against the libffi8
    ABI, and future versions of them will pick up a dependency on
    libgirepository-1.0-1-with-libffi8, but their versions in bullseye and
    testing are not compatible with a version of gobject-introspection that
    was compiled against libffi8. (Also necessary for #995032)
